      <h3>Favourite Git command</h3>


      <p>Git stash push: This command is one of my favorite Git commands because it allows us to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed, making it easy to switch contexts or work on a different task without cluttering your commit history or worrying about losing work. Here are some reasons why I find it useful are temporary storage, clean commit history, easy retrieval and flexibility.</p>
          
            <p>Here's an example command that illustrates the usage of git stash push: git stash push -m "Work in progress: feature X"</p>
          
            <p>This command stashes the current changes in the working directory with a message indicating that it's a work in progress for feature X. Later, when you're ready to retrieve these changes, you can use git stash pop or git stash apply to reapply them to your working directory. </p>
